# PC-CustomList
A custom /list plugin for servers using PureChat!

This plugin creates a custom /list command to display players names like pocketmine but with the purechat nametag format. This plugin will only show the players nametag, so if you set tags or a prefix/suffix in nametags this will also be shown.

## You must have PureChat installed for this plugin to work.
